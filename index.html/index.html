                        Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, is a disease that affects a person's brain and behavior and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medication. Substances such as alcohol, marijuana and nicotine also are considered drugs.
                        Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a recreational drug in social situations, and, for some people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, drug addiction begins with exposure to prescribed medications, or receiving medications from a friend or relative who has been prescribed the medication.

                        The risk of addiction and how fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, such as opioid painkillers, have a higher risk and cause addiction more quickly than others.

                <h4>What Causes Drug Addiction</h4>
                <p>
                    An action performed once as an experiment in a social situation can soon develop into a habit. An experimental use of alcohol at a college party can be used as an example. Substances such as alcohol and nicotine can affect the way one feels. Some people enjoy the physical and mental stimulations these substances create. In most cases, it is highly likely for the individual to get obsessed with such feelings. This condition ultimately leads the person to develop an addiction to that particular substance. Some people get addicted to even more than one substance.

        <p>Most people who suffer with substance abuse disorder (SUD) tend to hide their condition and prefer not to be vocal about it.</p><br>

                As per the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 19.7 million adults in the U.S. battled SUD in 2017 (individuals who are aged 12 and older).

                One out of every eight adults had both SUD and AUD in the same year.

            <h2>Well - Known Causes Of Drug Addiction</h2>
            <p>
                In most cases, substance abuse disorder is usually developed due to many social, personal, and environmental causes. However, some of these causes give the victim no control over them due to the size of their complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mentioned below are the most common causes of drug addiction:
            </p>
            <h3>Environmental Factors:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Having a group of friends who consume drugs. Peer pressure is considered to be one of the top causes of alcoholism and SUD. Many young individuals are reported to have started consuming drugs for the first time due to peer pressure from a group of friends who were frequent consumers themselves.</li>
                <li>One’s family’s attitudes and beliefs.</li>
                <li>Lack of family support or being ignored by parents.</li>
                <li>The life incidents one witnesses as a child tend to play a significant.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Genetics:</h3>
            <ul>
                <img src="https://vertavahealthtexas.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Is-Addiction-Genetic.jpg" alt="image">
                <li>
                    A person’s genetics can affect the progress of his/her drug addiction. They play a vital role in increasing or decreasing the speed of the progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A family history of any addiction is a risk factor here.

                <strong> Intervention for Drug Addiction</strong>
           </h2>
            <p>
                Keeping their disorder to themselves and not willing to open up to other people about it are common causes of complications seen in those suffering with SUD. An intervention for SUD is a structured opportunity for 
                <a href="https://pinnacletreatment.com/blog/executive-director-inks-new-book-addiction-from-bondage-to-freedom/">you are loved one</a>
                 to share thoughts about the addiction. Staging an intervention may be difficult at first. But the victim’s family and friends are encouraged to initiate it. In pressing cases, where the victim is unwilling to listen to family or friends, an alcohol/drug counselor or a treatment specialist is advised to be brought in. The heart-to-heart conversations brought out in this intervention usually show positive results and help those struggling in progressing towards recovery.
